                    <p>
                      The pre-run extract project centered around creating an extract for a mass update process related to PHR removal 
                      via a COBOL program. Utilizing JCL, DB2 SQL, VSAM, COBOL, and batch processing techniques my primary responsibility
                      was to develop and execute the pre-run extract ensuring that valid records are extracted according to defined business
                      rules. Worked with input control files, applied SQL-based filtering criteria, managed error handling and fallout 
                      reporting, and generated structured output files. Additionally, I optimized data extraction logic, debuged issues, and 
                      ensured seamless integration with the broader mass update workflow.

                      plant locations, and vaccine data. It involved refactoring SQL queries, optimizing Lambda execution, and implementing 
                      logic updates to align with daily data refresh requirements. My contributions centered around improving query 
                      performance, refining Lambda execution logic, and ensuring accurate data integration within the Mantis Lake 
                      environment.

                  <p>
                    This project involved the development and optimization of a Power BI dashboard to manage and track the logistics of the 
                    P23 vaccine across multiple partners providing real-time analytics related to vaccine inventory, 
                    shipments, availability, expiration dates, and dose demand. My contributions included dashboard enhancements, data 
                    transformation, and pipeline development. I refined data models, implemented dashboard adjustments, and ensured proper 
                    documentation to support a scalable and efficient logistics tracking system for the P23 vaccine. SQL logic was applied 
                    for data validation and Power BI optimizations ensured that partners received accurate, real-time analytics tailored 
                    to their needs.
